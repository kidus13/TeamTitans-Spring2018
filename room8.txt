You have now entered...

the Large Chamber - Room 8:
“A large, mostly empty room with several large, collapsed, halls
that would have lead out. There are stairs leading up, with a mist
falling down and floating towards one of the collapsed halls.  
There is also a large Earthen Golem blocking the stairway.”

====================================
The Monster that resides here is...

the Earth Golem - Monster 3:
Large and durable, this golem is quite fast, and won’t let
you go to the next floor. However, it doesn’t seem to be 
trying to kill you. It only has a 25% chance of doing damage
even without water. After splashing with water, you can simply
run past the golem, as it has slowed down
