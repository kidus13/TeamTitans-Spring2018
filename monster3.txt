Earth Golem - Monster 3
Large and durable, this golem is quite fast, and won’t let
 you go to the next floor. However, it doesn’t seem to be 
 trying to kill you. It only has a 25% chance of doing damage
 even without water. After splashing with water, you can simply
run past the golem, as it has slowed down
