=========================================
Guardian's Station - Room 2:
Only slightly larger than the previous room, there is a 
sleeping guard sitting in a chair in the far corner.  You
can try to sneak by, or start a fight.
Attacking the sleeping guard(monster) gives the player a free hit.

Would you like to examine monster?
Type "e" to examine.
