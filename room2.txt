Guardian's Station - Room 2:
“Only slightly larger than the previous room, there is a sleeping guard sitting in a chair in the far corner.  You can try to sneak by, or start a fight.  Fighting would cause a lot of noise though”
Fighting in this room wakes up the guard in ER03, who will try to fight the player.
Attacking the sleeping guard give the player a free hit.
