Fire Cavern 4 - Room 21:
“This room is very dark in the beginning but gets lighter
 and lighter the deeper you go into and it becomes hotter 
 and harder to breathe as if the room itself is leading you 
 to something sinister. “  At the end of the room there is a 
 door that reads "Equip what is hot to enter”
