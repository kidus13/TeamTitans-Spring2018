Tornado Alley - Room 30:
“This large hallway has some walls missing, making
 it a chore to traverse due to the altitude giving 
 heavy winds. There are a few bats in this room that
  stare at you as you enter, but they seem unfazed by the 
 wind. They are enticed by one of your potions.” 
“Heavy armor will help with these strong winds.”
