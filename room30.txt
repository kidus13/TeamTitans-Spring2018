=========================================
Tornado Alley - Room 30:
This large hallway has some walls missing, making
it a chore to traverse due to the altitude giving 
heavy winds. There are a few bats in this room that
stare at you as you enter, but they seem unfazed by the 
wind. They are enticed by one of your potions. 
Heavy armor will help with these strong winds.

Would you like to examine monster?
Type "e" to examine.
