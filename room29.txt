Antarctic Room - Room 29:
 “This room is a decent size, very open with two  
 lamps to light the room on the south wall, as well
as two windows on the north wall. A pudgy, penguin-like
guard stands in the center, with a curved shortsword. 
He seems angry, but due to his size, he cannot move very 
fast. To the east is a door to a hallway.”

Penguin Guard - Monster 12
“As a flightless member of the air guard, he does not have the highest honor.
However, his slow movement is made up for by packing a powerful punch.”
