=========================================
Fire Cavern 5 - Room 22:
“This room is very bright and soon as you walk in the warmth
hits you and so does the light and it hurts to even look around 
the room. As your eyes begin to adjust you see lava hot
springs shooting up everywhere and a huge 
object in the back of the room that looks to be sleeping

Would you like to examine the monster?
Type "e" to examine.
