Fire Cavern 5 - Room 22:
“This room is very bright and soon as you walk in the warmth
 hits you and so does the light it hurts to even look around 
 the room. ““As your eyes begin to adjust you see lava hot
  springs shooting up everywhere and a huge 
object in the back of the room that looks to be sleeping”

===================================
The Monster that resides here is...

the Ultimate HellFire Beast - Monster 9
“The heat that comes off his body is enough to melt anything
above ground so he must be kept within his own realm.”
