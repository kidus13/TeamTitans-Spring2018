Raven Room - Room 34: 
“A giant birdman in fancy garb looks at you with
 angst, ready to strike. The room is huge, and torches light
 it across the walls toward the ceiling.”
 
 ===========================
 King Flightgrand IV is in this room: 
 “His leadership, charisma, helped him win the respect of his
  people until his friendliness put his kingdom in jeopardy 
  when he was taken advantage of by neighboring societies. 
  Rumor has it that you were to blame, therefore you are his 
  worst enemy.”
