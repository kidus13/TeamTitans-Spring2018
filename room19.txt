Fire Cavern 2:
This room is completely dark and there are pools of wet 
steamy black fluid everywhere and you see a glow in the 
background and hear a loud growl.  The ground begins to rumble
and that same light begins coming towards you at an
incredible speed as the ground shakes harder and harder!!!

Would you like to examine the monster?
Type "e" to examine.
